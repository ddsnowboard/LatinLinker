LatinLinker
===========
So, now what I'm doing is I'm just going to have a box, you paste in the text, and it'll linkify whatever you paste. 


#Specification

The main page will be a text entry box and a "Submit" button in the beginning, followed by a setup very similar to thelatinlibrary.com by the end, where you can pick author, text, and chapter/book. Then, it will be formatted almost exactly like [this page](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/vergil/aen1.shtml), but every individual word, except for the headers and line numbers, will be a link to the page for it on William Whitaker's Words. 

*Technical Note:* The format for the dictionary entry on Whitaker's Words is "http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=%s", where %s is the word. 

Ideally, it would have the text on the left hand side, and then the dictionary entry would pop up not in a new window but on the right side.
